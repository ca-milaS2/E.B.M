    <div class="text">
        <p>The feasibility of constructing an isolated habitat is directly supported by field-tested applications of
            CTBs (Cargo Transfer Bag), as detailed in the <a rel="sites" href="https://hdl.handle.net/2014/45116">"Dual
                Use of Packaging on the Moon:
                Logistics-2-Living"</a> document. These packages can be repurposed for both internal and external
            structures.</p>

        <p><strong>Internal Compartmentalization:</strong> For creating isolated internal spaces, the document points to
            a practical result:</p>
        <blockquote>"In addition to the right and left halves of the geo-science workstation, partitions and doors were
            installed using unfolded L2L2009 CTBs, creating a small compartment that could be sealed off from the rest
            of the Microhab."</blockquote>
        <p>This proves that CTBs can effectively create functional modules, essential for establishing dedicated
            workspaces.</p>

        <p><strong>External Structures:</strong> Furthermore, the concept scales up to the construction of robust
            external structures, treating the CTB as a primary building material:</p>
        <blockquote>"It has also been proposed to use expended CTBs external to the outpost as bricks for in-situ
            structures. Empty CTBs would be filled with regolith and piled in alternating courses..."</blockquote>
        <p>This use of CTBs for civil construction allows for the creation of protective walls, supporting the
            development of a fully independent habitat.</p>

        <h2>The Core System: Closed-Loop Manufacturing from Mission Waste</h2>
        <p>A critical aspect of the habitat's autonomy is its ability to convert waste into valuable resources. We
            propose a dedicated module that houses a sufficient number of shredders and an electromagnetic inductor to
            transform plastic and metallic trash into standardized 3D printing filament.</p>

        <h3>The Technology: Electromagnetic Induction Heating</h3>
        <p>This system's core is electromagnetic induction, a versatile technology for processing both polymers and
            metals. As described by Mariani and Malucelli (2023), it efficiently heats polymer composites. Furthermore,
            its effectiveness in processing aluminum alloys—a common aerospace waste material—has been confirmed by
            Gariépy and D’Amours (2023), making it an ideal all-in-one solution.</p>

        <h3>The Process: From Recycled Waste to Filament</h3>
        <p>The manufacturing process for 3D filament begins with the critical step of drying polymer pellets to remove
            any absorbed moisture. Subsequently, these pellets are melted and forced through a precision nozzle within
            an extruder to form a continuous strand. This filament is then immediately cooled in a water bath while its
            diameter is continuously monitored and adjusted in real-time via a feedback loop between a laser micrometer
            and a set of pullers. Finally, the precisely dimensioned filament is wound onto spools, and the final
            product is vacuum-sealed with a desiccant to ensure its quality and prevent moisture reabsorption.</p>

        <h2>Addressing Challenges: Advanced Composites from Recycled Materials</h2>
        <p>While recycling is promising, utilizing recycled materials for high-performance applications presents known
            challenges, especially when incorporating reinforcing agents like carbon fiber (CF).</p>
        <blockquote>"The electrophoretic deposition of CNT/MFC onto the surface of recycled carbon fibers proved to be
            an effective method for enhancing the adhesion and interaction between the matrix and fibers... enhancing
            chemical bonding sites with the polymer matrix."</blockquote>

        <h2>Powering the System: Energy Autonomy from Packaging</h2>
        <p>To achieve true autonomy, the habitat and its recycling systems require a self-sufficient power source. The
            "Dual Use of Packaging" document presents an elegant solution by integrating power generation directly into
            the CTB material itself:</p>
        <blockquote>"...A third proposal was to manufacture the rectangles with flexible photovoltaic sections, so that
            the empty CTB could be used to lay across the ground outside and increase the power-generation capacity of
            the outpost."</blockquote>

        <h2>Problems to be solved</h2>
        <h3>Waste Generated</h3>
        <p>The heating of plastic waste will generate Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). According to the U.S.
            Environmental Protection Agency, VOCs are compounds that have a high vapor pressure and low water
            solubility. There are various methods to capture these emissions, including incineration, condensation,
            absorption, and biological methods.</p>

        <h3>Filtering different types of polymers and aluminum alloys</h3>
        <p>To reutilize the polymer needs to be pure, the presence of unwanted materials may compromise the process of
            rearranging the polymer or aluminum. The separation by identification code in the polymer item may help and
            an exclusive shredder for determined material may prevent contamination.</p>
