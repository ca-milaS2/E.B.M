## 1. Introduction âœ¨

After a long journey through space, Cesinha and his crew finally landed on Mars!
Their first challenge? Setting up the inflatable habitat that will become their new home.
Carefully, they connect each corner of the 3D structure that gives shape and strength to the shelter. Once everything is in place, they realize that the cube and leftover materials still hold great potential.
Now the mission is clear: recycle, reinvent, and give new purpose to Martian waste!

## 2. Key Questions ðŸš©
- How can they handle waste in a smart and sustainable way?
- Is it possible to reduce the volume and reuse every piece?
- How can they save NASAâ€™s resources and still create something new?
- And most importantly, how can they transform trash into Class 2 materials â€” ready for a second life on Mars?
