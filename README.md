### 3.1. The feasibility of creating an isolated habitat powered by CTBs is based on the following excerpts from the document ["Dual Use of Packaging on the Moon: Logistics-2-Living"]():  

- Firstly, regarding the ability to create an isolated internal space, the text points to a practical result from field tests:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äã"In addition to the right and left halves of the geo-science workstation, partitions and doors were installed using unfolded L2L2009 CTBs, creating a small compartment that could be sealed off from the rest of the Microhab".  
This excerpt proves that CTBs can be used to create compartmentalized and functional internal spaces, going beyond a simple partition.  
- Next, the idea is expanded to the construction of external structures, treating the CTB as a construction material:  
‚Äã&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has also been proposed to use expended CTBs external to the outpost as bricks for in-situ structures. Empty CTBs would be filled with regolith and piled in alternating courses[...]".  
Here, the proposal scales the use of CTBs for civil construction, allowing for the creation of walls and external structures, which supports the idea of a separate habitat.  
- ‚ÄãFinally, on the issue of energy, the document suggests a modification to the packaging material itself:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"[...]A third proposal was to manufacture the rectangles with flexible photovoltaic sections, so that the empty CTB could be used to lay across the ground outside and increase the power-generation capacity of the outpost".  
‚Äã&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This passage introduces the energy solution, proposing that the packages themselves could power the habitat they helped build, thus closing the loop for an autonomous module.
